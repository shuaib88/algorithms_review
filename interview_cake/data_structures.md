# Data Structures

## Collections

### Dictionary

- LookUp Time = O(1)
- Insert
- Sort
- Copy = o(n)

* Keys must be hashable (and contain hashable objects if a collection)
* Python hash implemented as an array, after insertion if space is 2/3, dictionary \
    gets resized, empty array allocated 8 slots
* Output of hash function is an array index

- how is hashtable implemented? what is the output of the hasfunction? \
    a spot in memory an array index? How much space gets allocated for a dict?
